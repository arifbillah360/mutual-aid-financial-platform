/*
 * This file is a placeholder for `public/js/modal-handler.js`.
 * In this Laravel 11 project, modal handling logic
 * is entirely managed using Alpine.js directly within Blade templates.
 *
 * Alpine.js `x-data` and `x-show` attributes provide reactive and
 * declarative ways to control modal visibility and behavior without
 * the need for separate JavaScript files.
 *
 * For optimal performance and maintainability, it's recommended
 * to manage all JavaScript within `resources/js/app.js` or inline
 * with Alpine.js attributes in Blade templates, processed by Vite.
