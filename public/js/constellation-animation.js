/*
 * This file is a placeholder for `public/js/constellation-animation.js`.
 * In this Laravel 11 project with Alpine.js and Vite,
 * animation logic for constellations (e.g., rotation) is primarily handled
 * by CSS animations defined in `resources/css/app.css` or
 * directly within Blade components using Alpine.js for dynamic behaviors.
 *
 * For optimal performance and maintainability, it's recommended
 * to manage all JavaScript within `resources/js/app.js` or inline
 * with Alpine.js attributes in Blade templates, processed by Vite.
