/*
 * This file is a placeholder for `public/js/table-animations.js`.
 * In this Laravel 11 project, table animations like blinking effects
 * are primarily handled by CSS keyframes defined in `resources/css/app.css`
 * and applied via Tailwind classes or directly in Blade components.
 *
 * For dynamic table interactions, Alpine.js can be integrated directly
 * within Blade templates using `x-data` attributes.
 *
 * For optimal performance and maintainability, it's recommended
 * to manage all JavaScript within `resources/js/app.js` or inline
 * with Alpine.js attributes in Blade templates, processed by Vite.
