/*
 * This file is a placeholder for `public/js/confetti-animation.js`.
 * In this Laravel 11 project, continuous confetti animation logic
 * is implemented using a custom Alpine.js component defined in
 * `resources/js/app.js` and applied directly in Blade templates
 * using `x-data="confettiMachine(...)`.
 *
 * For optimal performance and maintainability, it's recommended
 * to manage all JavaScript within `resources/js/app.js` or inline
 * with Alpine.js attributes in Blade templates, processed by Vite.
