/*
 * This file is a placeholder for `public/css/components.css`.
 * In this Laravel 11 project with Vite and Tailwind CSS,
 * all actual CSS content, including component-specific styling,
 * is consolidated into `resources/css/app.css`.
 *
 * Vite processes `resources/css/app.css` and outputs the compiled CSS.
 * For optimal performance and maintainability, it's recommended
 * to manage all styles within `resources/css/app.css` and
 * leverage Tailwind's JIT compilation and tree-shaking.
 *
 * Styles for cards, modals, buttons, and other components,
 * including modern glassmorphism effects, have been moved to
 * `resources/css/app.css` and are applied via Tailwind classes
 * or Blade components.
