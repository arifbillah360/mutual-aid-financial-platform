/*
 * This file is a placeholder for `public/css/confetti.css`.
 * In this Laravel 11 project with Vite and Tailwind CSS,
 * all actual CSS content, including confetti animation keyframes,
 * is consolidated into `resources/css/app.css`.
 *
 * Vite processes `resources/css/app.css` and outputs the compiled CSS.
 * For optimal performance and maintainability, it's recommended
 * to manage all styles within `resources/css/app.css` and
 * leverage Tailwind's JIT compilation and tree-shaking.
 *
 * The confetti animation (`fall` keyframe) and individual piece styling
 * are defined in `resources/css/app.css` and dynamically applied
 * using an Alpine.js component in `resources/views/components/confetti.blade.php`.
