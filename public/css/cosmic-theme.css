/*
 * This file is a placeholder for `public/css/cosmic-theme.css`.
 * In this Laravel 11 project with Vite and Tailwind CSS,
 * all actual CSS content, including theme-specific styles,
 * animations, and component styling, is consolidated into
 * `resources/css/app.css`.
 *
 * Vite processes `resources/css/app.css` and outputs the compiled CSS.
 * For optimal performance and maintainability, it's recommended
 * to manage all styles within `resources/css/app.css` and
 * leverage Tailwind's JIT compilation and tree-shaking.
 *
 * The original `index.html` structure's CSS definitions
 * for the cosmic background and animations have been moved
 * to `resources/css/app.css` and applied globally via the `body`
 * or specific Blade components.
