/*
 * This file is a placeholder for `public/css/animations.css`.
 * In this Laravel 11 project with Vite and Tailwind CSS,
 * all actual CSS content, including animation keyframes,
 * is consolidated into `resources/css/app.css`.
 *
 * Vite processes `resources/css/app.css` and outputs the compiled CSS.
 * For optimal performance and maintainability, it's recommended
 * to manage all styles within `resources/css/app.css` and
 * leverage Tailwind's JIT compilation and tree-shaking.
 *
 * The original `index.html` structure's CSS definitions
 * for animations (blinking, glow-zoom, rotate) have been moved
 * to `resources/css/app.css` and are applied via Tailwind classes
 * or direct Alpine.js bindings in Blade components.
