/*
 * This file is a placeholder for `public/css/tables.css`.
 * In this Laravel 11 project with Vite and Tailwind CSS,
 * all actual CSS content, including table-specific styling and
 * responsive behaviors, is consolidated into `resources/css/app.css`.
 *
 * Vite processes `resources/css/app.css` and outputs the compiled CSS.
 * For optimal performance and maintainability, it's recommended
 * to manage all styles within `resources/css/app.css` and
 * leverage Tailwind's JIT compilation and tree-shaking.
 *
 * Responsive table styling (horizontal scroll on small screens)
 * is handled via Tailwind's `overflow-x-auto` class on the parent container
 * of the table element.
